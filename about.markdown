I'm Txus, a software/ML engineer working at [Factorial][factorial]. I'm obsessed with all things AI, especially reinforcement learning.

Teaching is one of my passions! Currently teaching MLOps at [UPC's Artificial Intelligence with Deep Learning](https://www.talent.upc.edu/ing/estudis/formacio/curs/310400/postgrau-artificial-intelligence-deep-learning/){:target="_blank"} postgraduate course.

Learning languages is another one of my passions. I'm currently exploring ways to improve that for myself and others with LLMs.

If you're working on something cool, be it a business or a side-project, and would like to bounce some ideas, I'm happy to chat. Like everyone, I have limited bandwidth, but I very much enjoy helping folks who are building cool things, in whichever way I can.
